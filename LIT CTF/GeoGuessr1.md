# Solution
The first thing I noticed were the flag and the blue banner on the right. Searching online I found the flag, and it was Monaco's flag. This gives us a great hint, because this is a relatively small country.
Then I started looking for the shop with that banner. I thought it said "DRM", so I looked for it with Google Maps not finding anything useful. I also looked for Smart shops, but there were many and was bothered to check them all. So I googled "DRM Monaco" and found the correct shop I was looking for, that was spelled "DPM". So I went back to Google Maps to find this shop but I found one that looked nothing like the picture, that was called "D.P.M. Motors". I wandered for some time on GMaps until I found the other DPM shop, that was the one I was looking for, that was called "DPM Classic". [Link Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/CCLsGsy5s5xCtTcE6)
